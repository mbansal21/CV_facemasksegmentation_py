In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a Face Mask Segmentation model which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image.

Data Description:
  WIDER FACE dataset is a Face Mask Segmentation benchmark dataset, of which images are selected from the publicly available WIDER dataset.
  In this project, we are using 409 images and around 1000 faces for ease of computation.
  
Objective:
  In this problem, we use "Transfer Learning" of an Image Segmentation model to detect any object according to the problem in hand.
  Here, we are particularly interested in segmenting faces in a given image
